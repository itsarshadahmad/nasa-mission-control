# NASA Mission Control
A NASA Mission Control team analyzes Kepler data to identify habitable exoplanets and generates a list of habitable planets. Data from SpaceX launches is also collected, so launch history and upcoming launches are also populated. In other words, it's a simulation of mission control software, so you can schedule any future mission in the simulated mission control web app. You can cancel missions and can see records in history and upcoming.
